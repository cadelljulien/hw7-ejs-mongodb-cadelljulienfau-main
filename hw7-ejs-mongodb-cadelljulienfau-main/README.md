Homework 7 was by far the hardest homework to complete. First started off with a day being striped, meaning I'll have to work with less days. Stated off with previous code I had. Had some help in creating the post. With the post I worked with a classmate to get things set, and then use chatgpt to create a search and delete and updated my other methods off of it. At first it couldn't really understand it but with proper talking and such it became easier to understand what is happening. But going back the ejs was soemthing else as it was something enterily different then what I had expected. Even though I had learning curve, I'd say it was good. No moving forward back to the methods, I'd say they were tactiful, or I had to be to get things rolling but I'd say it all worked in the end as I learnt more then exspected even though my brain is fried.
